You can contact members of the student council as well as many other computer science students via the channels below.

For HHU students there is also the [INPhiMa Discord](./studienanfaenger/social-media.en.md).

```ad-note
Please note that although we study computer science, we do not provide tech support. We help HHU students with organizational problems and minor content-related questions, but we are not a contact point for the general public and cannot help you repair your printer or similar.

## Alträte-IRC

There is one last remnant from the days of the Internet: IRC chat. The abbreviation IRC stands for something we have forgotten.
It is also no longer relevant these days. A few former councillors hang around in the channel itself and plan their weekly shopping, spring cleaning or their next trip to the cinema.

You can join in with this data:

- Network: irc.quakenet.org
- Channel: #hhu-fscs

### Tips for the channel

- If you have a question, ask it directly.
- Almost nobody is online, but almost everyone uses bouncers, so it looks like you are online.
- Asking questions about the examination regulations is almost pointless. Almost no one present there knows the current PO.

## Opening hours

The Computer Science Student Council is usually open on weekdays from 8am to 6pm.
