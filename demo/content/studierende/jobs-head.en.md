Here we provide information about current vacancies. If you are interested in 
networking with companies and professionals, we can also recommend attending 
<a href="https://fscs.hhu.de/de/veranstaltungen/branchenevents/" target="_blank">industry events</a>.

Job vacancies relating to IT can be sent to us by E-mail (fscs(at)hhu.de) 
as a PDF. Offers will be deleted after six months if we do not receive 
notification in good time that the position is still available.

In addition, we can recommend the <a href="https://www.stellenwerk.de/duesseldorf" target="_blank">Stellenwerk</a>, 
the official job portal of the HHU, which was launched in July 2024.

The AStA of the University of DÃ¼sseldorf regularly advertises jobs on <a href="https://astahhu.de/stellenausschreibungen/" target="_blank">this</a> site.
If you have any questions about applying, starting a job or your career, the 
university's <a href="https://www.studierendenakademie.hhu.de/career-service.html" target="_blank">Career Service</a> can also help.
