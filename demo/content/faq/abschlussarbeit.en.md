### How do I determine what my specialisation and compulsory electives are?

As you write your Bachelor's thesis in your specialisation (10 CP),
the modules that are assigned to the specialisation should match the topic of the thesis
or at least from the chair's point of view, match the topic of the thesis to some extent.
You can find out which compulsory elective subjects belong to the specialisation from
from [Mrs
Vandrey](https://www.hhu.de/studium/studienorganisation/das-studierenden-service-center/studierenden-und-pruefungsverwaltung)
. It is best to make the assignment when you already know at which chair you will write your Bachelor's thesis.

The assignment does not play a role in the Bachelor's degree average:
Both compulsory elective modules and specialisation modules are counted twice in the
double in the evaluation. \[§ 3 PO, subject-specific appendix\]

### Where can I get a topic for my Bachelor's thesis?
The chairs often have lists of possible topics for theses on their websites.
topics for theses
([here](https://stups.pages.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/abschlussarbeiten/offene-themen/)
for example at the Stups Chair) or a list of completed theses from which

academic staff member of the course on whose topic you would like to

topic suggestion or a cautious "I am very interested in uv after your event xy, and would like to write my BA about it.
about it. Is that possible and how do you go about finding a topic?").

### When should I look for a topic?

As early as possible, it can (but doesn't have to) take a while until you finally
finally have a topic. Three months before graduation, for example, would be a bit
a little tight. If you want to finish in summer semester 2018, you should
towards the end of the WiSe 2017 lecture period at the latest.
### How do I register the work?

You go to Mrs Vandrey (aka examination office, in the SSC,
[office hours](https://www.hhu.de/studium/studienorganisation/das-studierenden-service-center/studierenden-und-pruefungsverwaltung))
and say that you would like to register your BA and need the appropriate
form (she will know what you mean). You can get the form

you start looking for a subject; the form does not expire. You then use it
you fill in the part that you have to complete yourself, go to your supervisor
to your supervisor, who will then take care of everything else. After a few
week you will receive a letter from the examination office asking you to
to collect the topic from the examination office within 14 days. With
collection begins the 3-month period. When you collect the topic
Mrs Vandrey will also ask you to check whether the title of your thesis
title corresponds to your own ideas and is written correctly;
This should also be done sensibly if you don't want a typo on your
certificate later on.
### Where can I have the work printed and bound?

At your favourite copy shop, e.g. at the
[Uni-Kopier-Center](https://osm.org/go/0GDzC_ra1--?m=&way=332128509) bei
the university clinics (44 pages printed on both sides, triplicate version
with adhesive binding approx. 45 €; depending on the binding chosen, it only takes 30
minutes to 3 hours, but you should not necessarily wait until the day of submission
think about printing).

### How long should the BA be?

"The length of the written thesis should be 25 to 30 pages.
pages." \[§ 16 para. 9 PO 2013, § 16 para. 8 PO 2016, subject-specific
Appendix\] After consultation with the supervisor, it is usually not a problem
if you overrun a few pages.

### What is the date of my degree?

There are two dates on the degree certificate: The date of the last
examination (this is the date of graduation; if the BA is the last
is the last examination, then this is the date of submission and _not_ the date of the
the date of the [oral presentation](#vortrag)) and when you received the certificate.

### How many copies of the Bachelor's thesis do I need to have printed?

In the letter from the examination office, in which the topic of the thesis
is specified, it states how many copies must be submitted.

PO 2013: _three_ printed copies must be submitted. (One each
to the two reviewers, the third goes to the examination

PO 2016: _two_ printed copies must be submitted and
an electronic version must be submitted to the supervisor at the same time.

digital submission. Talk to your supervisor about this.

### Does written programme code have to be handed in?

If part of the work consists of writing programme code, this is usually
normally submitted on a CD with the printed thesis.
However, ask your supervisor again how/if code should be handed in.

### What and when is the oral presentation?

Shortly after submitting your written thesis, you have to give an oral
give an oral presentation on your topic. \[§ 16 para. 9 PO 2013, § 16
Para. 8 PO 2016, subject-specific appendix\] The date is agreed with the

your supervisor directly about the presentation, you should ask yourself when the
presentation should take place. As a rule, the presentation should be approx. 20
minutes long, after which you may be asked questions about your
questions about your work. The presentation is open to the public, but a

## Transition from Bachelor to Master

### How do I enrol for the Master's programme?

For the Computer Science Master's programme in Düsseldorf you need an average of
2.5 or better or an average of 3.0 or better with a BA of
1.5 or better. "Graduates of the Bachelor's degree programme in Computer Science at
the University of Düsseldorf (who fulfil the above grade criterion)
above) will receive a certificate of admission to the Master's programme
certificate of admission to the Master's degree programme (limited to enrolment
enrolment for the next semester). In this case, the
application to the Examination Board is not necessary, enrolment on the

is not yet available, via
[digstu.hhu.de](https://digstu.hhu.de/qisserver/pages/cs/sys/portal/hisinoneStartPage.faces)
. However, if the Bachelor's certificate and the grade are already available
then a change of subject application
\[[https://www.hhu.de/formulare](https://www.hhu.de/studium/bewerbung-und-einschreibung/formulare-/-downloads)\]
must be completed."

If the BA is submitted at the end of the semester, so that you do not receive the
admission certificate before the start of the first Master's semester
semester, you register normally for the next semester for the Bachelor's programme
semester and can then, upon receipt of the certificate of
completed degree programme, you can then transfer to the Master's programme retroactively.
The best way to do this is to go to the enrolment officer for Computer Science
([Office hours](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/studium-und-lehre-an-der-hhu/studium/pruefungen/ansprechpartner.html)),
as they will immediately carry out the transfer and, if desired
issue a new student ID card directly. (You can also

process takes a few days).

## Project work

### What is the project work?

Project work is a compulsory module in the Master's programme. "The project work
serves as preparation for the Master's thesis and should generally be

is carried out." \[§ 3 para. 3 PO, subject-specific appendix\] What this means in concrete terms
depends on the chair: Prepared paper research with a view to a
paper research with a view to a possible Master's thesis, continuation of the
of the Bachelor's thesis, continuation of a seminar topic, own proposal
etc. As a rule, you will be integrated in some way into the "day-to-day operations"
of the chair (by this we don't mean making coffee, but participating in group
participation in group meetings etc.) and the project work is designed in such a way
that it can lead to a Master's thesis.

### When do I write the project work?

Usually in the second and third Master's semester. In the first semester
you have time to find out which chair you would like to write your

### How much time is required for the project work?

There are 20 CP for each module, i.e. you have to invest 600 hours of time
(theoretically, but depending on the chair, you have to keep a record of how much
how much you have worked).

### How do I determine what my specialisation and compulsory electives are?

As you write your Master's thesis in your specialisation (30 CP), you should
the modules that are assigned to your specialisation should

## LaTeX

### Is there a LaTeX template for Bachelor's or Master's theses?

Yes, on the [page of the
DBS chair](https://dbs.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/lehre/bmarbeit/) you can download a

bibliography (with sample entries) everything you need.
But don't forget to adapt the name of the chair if necessary (and if

### Do I have to write the BibTex entries for the bibliography myself?

Of course you can, but there are alternatives:

- Search in the [ULB catalogue](https://ulb.hhu.de), then in the

### What about spell and grammar checking in LaTeX?

TeXstudio (and probably many other editors) support
spelling checker, you may simply have to look in the settings
where you can activate the German spell checker.

TeXstudio, for example, also supports grammar checking using
[LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org); it is advisable to deactivate the following rules,

TeXstudio's own word repetition check should be deactivated, as
LangaugeTool can do this better.

Be careful not to use constructs like `"u`, but enter umlauts
and sharp S directly.

### How do I insert German (typographical) inverted commas?

``"`So"'``. TeXstudio, for example, can be configured so that
the corresponding opening/closing quotation mark is entered directly when entering a "
inverted commas are entered directly (_Settings_ → _Editor_ → _Replace
Double Quotes_).

### Hyphenation of hyphenated words does not work correctly.

a clear overview of which hyphens have what effect on hyphenation.

you should check whether you can help the hyphenation manually (with `""`).
can help.

### How do I prevent line breaks within abbreviations?

With a narrow, protected space: `z.\,B.`

### Should I version the work (e.g. with git)?

Yes and yes. Source code should be versioned for the usual reasons:
You experiment a bit, discard something, want to use Travis CI,
you need git bisect, something suddenly stops working.
(You should have learnt in Propra why git is helpful here.
LaTeX code should also be versioned. Then you can simply
structure completely over the top or delete passages and you know for
know for sure that you can get them back. Or if something is suddenly
something is displayed incorrectly, you can quickly find out which newly
package is responsible.

And for source code such as BA text: git is a simple
synchronisation option and you have a direct backup on the

you have to write a programme, you can simply make the source code available to testers.

### Is there a template for the presentation?

For the presentation you can use the [LaTeX Beamer presentation template in
HHU-style](https://wwwcn.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/teaching/vorlage_beamer.zip)
of the Computer Networks Chair.

### Is there such a presentation console for LaTeX projector presentations, with elapsed time, display of notes and next slide?

Yes, [PDF Presenter Console (pdfpc)](https://pdfpc.github.io/).
