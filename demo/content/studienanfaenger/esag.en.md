The ESAG (Erstsemester Arbeitsgemeinschaft) of the Fachschaft Informatik (and the rest of InPhiMa) is our way of welcoming you to the University of DÃ¼sseldorf.

In the winter semester, this includes the spectacular, breathtaking, unforgettable, outstanding, phenomenal, annually
unique ESAG theatre, the insurmountable, challenging, humid, cheerful, fun and extremely important ESAG rally, as well as our phenomenal barbecues.

Even graduates still rightly reproach themselves if they have missed even one of these events. Forever!
