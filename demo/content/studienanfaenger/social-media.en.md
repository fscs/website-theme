We also offer a Discord server for mutual exchange.
Below you will find the access:

1. log in to pad.hhu.de
   Why ?: If you don't log in first, you can't join via the link in the next step. Pad.hhu.de does not automatically redirect you to the login (and then back to the original link)
2. [Click on the link](https://pad.hhu.de/s/aUKstXB2M)
   Why ?: We have placed the membership link in the pad so that only members of the HHU can join the server (If you do not yet have access data as a freshman or as an alumnus, you are welcome to send us an e-mail).
3. copy the link and either go to the link address or paste the link in the Discord app under (+) and “Join server”
4. read the channel “rules-and-infos” carefully and react to the last post accordingly for the role distributor
   Why: It's all in the rules
