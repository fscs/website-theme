## What can my semester ticket do?
The semester ticket is valid from 01.10.20XX, or from 01.04.20XX if you start in the summer semester. It is equivalent to the "Deutschland ticket".

## Identity management - I can't click on anything anywhere.
You probably have an iPhone. You have to activate the pop-ups in your browser.
- Open Chrome on your iPhone or iPad.
- Tap on the three-dot menu Settings .
- Tap on Content settings. Block pop-ups.
- Enable or disable block pop-ups.

## Why is something outlined in red in the timetable?
This means that there is a conflict in this period. In simple words: 2 lectures overlap. However, in most cases this is because you have selected the wrong view. At the top left you will see a dropdown menu where you can select a specific week. If the red border is still there, please do not hesitate to contact us.

## How do I set up HHU-Mail and what access data do I need for Roundcube?
For Roundcube you need your unique identifier (consisting of 3 letters, 2 numbers and another 3 letters) and your self-created password. You should use this data to log in to Roundcube. If this is not the case, you have probably forgotten to select the main email address in the IDM. These are only so-called aliases; you have different e-mail addresses that all lead to one mailbox.
If you have selected the main e-mail address and registration with roundcube still fails, don't hesitate to contact us.

## Where can I find study plans for my degree program?
You can easily find the study plan on the Internet. Enter the words “HHU Studienverlaufsplan” and your degree program and the first result should be the correct and current study plan.

## How long does it take for my enrollment application to be approved?
If you have submitted your complete enrollment application in [Digstu](https://digstu.hhu.de), then you have done everything you can up to this point. Approval usually takes between 1 and 4 weeks. If you are interested in taking part in a [preliminary course](https://www.math-nat-fak.hhu.de/studium/vor-/auffrischungskurse-1), you can register for one without enrolment.
To do this, register for the desired preliminary course via this [link](https://www.math-nat-fak.hhu.de/studium/vor-/auffrischungskurse-1/anmeldung). And register with a new user account in Ilias. The link to the pre-course Ilias will be sent to you by e-mail after you have registered for a pre-course.

## When will the HHU Card arrive?
After you have successfully enrolled, your HHU-Card will be produced automatically.
Delivery officially takes between 1-4 weeks. Experience has shown that it arrives in your mailbox after approx. 2 weeks.

## How do I receive university emails from Roundcube on my private mail app?
There are various options. Either you set up a forwarding in the Roundcube settings or you follow these instructions: [Set up Uni-Mail in various email programs](https://wiki.hhu.de/display/HHU/Anleitungen+zum+Einrichten+der+Uni-Mail+in+verschiedenen+E-Mail-Programmen)

## Where can I find the timetable?
The university is not comparable to a school you attend. Here you put together your own timetable by registering for modules via the LSF. However, there is no rush to do this before the ESAG (Ersti-Woche), as this is there to show you everything you need to know to organize yourself at university. This includes how to put together your “timetable”.

## From when to when is the Freshman Week?
The ESAG (Ersti-Woche) is from 30.09. - 04.10. The schedule on 30.09. is the same for all degree programs and can be viewed [here](https://www.esaghhu.de/fachschaften/). The following days depend on the student council and are organized by your responsible student council. You can visit [this](https://www.esaghhu.de/fachschaften/) page and scroll down. There you will find links to the student councils that have listed their schedule behind the link. 

## Are there Whatsapp groups for the individual degree programs?
By now, all degree programs should be listed behind [this](https://www.ersti-gruppen.de/hhu) link. Please note that these are unofficial groups and we cannot guarantee that all participants are students. These groups are public and can be joined by anyone. We have had bad experiences with these groups in the past and distance ourselves from any responsibility.

## I cannot take a module in LSF!
If you have successfully registered in the [LSF](https://lsf.hhu.de), it is most likely because the LSF is not in the correct semester. This can be easily changed. To do this, click on the semester displayed in the top right-hand corner of the LSF and change this to the semester for which you want to register for modules on the next page.

## I can't attend any exercise groups!
This is quite normal in many modules. If you cannot register via the LSF, you will most likely have to register via the [ILIAS](https://ilias.hhu.de) course for the module. In any case, you will receive reliable information in the first lecture of the respective module.

## How can I take exams?
You can take exams via the [student portal](https://studierende.hhu.de) (exam registrations (tab Links) -> new exam registration). You can also look up exam dates here.

## What is a tutorial and do I have to go there (Mat-Nath)?
What a tutorial is varies greatly from degree program to degree program. In most cases, in-depth content is considered or the current exercise sheet is discussed. The information about what exactly will happen is usually given in the first lecture.

## Is attendance compulsory?
No, unless otherwise specified.

## I have failed a module. Do I now have to repeat the first semester?
No! The course is modular! You can continue your studies as normal and design your studies individually! There is no “compulsory study plan”.

## I have e.g. a chronic illness, disability, ...
Then you can apply for compensation for disadvantages! [Here](https://www.hhu.de/bbst/nachteilsausgleich) you can find all the information you need! You should do this as early as possible!

## Where to get coffee
In the cafés and at the coffee machine in the library (behind the lockers).

## What is there to eat?
[essen.inphima.de](https://essen.inphima.de)

### Campus Vita (5-10€)
Cheap and restaurant-style food (pizza, burgers, pasta)

### Canteens (1,20-5€)
Very cheap canteen food. The oriental lentil stew often tastes exquisite. If you are vegan: the bread rolls contain milk.
