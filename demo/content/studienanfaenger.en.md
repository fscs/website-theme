```ad-note
Thank you for your interest in a Bachelor's/Master's degree program in Computer Science at Heinrich Heine University.
On these pages you will find everything you need to know (from a student's point of view) that you have not found on the other pages of the university.

Be sure to take a look at the next page on ESAG, our introductory event, to get your studies off to a good start

## Note on the winter semester 2023/2024

With the new examination regulations 2021 (PO21) there are two different sample study plans: One with the new maths modules for computer scientists, one with the old maths modules for mathematicians.
Below are the plans for the first winter semester:

- Sample study plan with maths for computer scientists
  - Mathematics for computer scientists 1
  - Programming
  - Computer architecture
  - Scientific work
- Sample study plan with mathematics of mathematics
  - Programming
  - Scientific work
  - Analysis I
  - Linear Algebra I

After registering in the LSF, you will be part of the mailing list and will then receive regular information about the schedule from the lecturers and relevant links (such as to web meetings or the lecture streams, or also to cancellations).

It is also worth checking [ILIAS](https://ilias.hhu.de) regularly to see if anything has already been announced there.
The ILIAS is a forum for modules. As soon as you are registered for a module in the [LSF](https://lsf.hhu.de),
you will be added to the respective course after a short time (3am in the morning), provided the lecturer works with the ILIAS.

You can register for the lectures via the course catalogue (LSF). You can find out exactly how to do this during our
first semester introduction or by coming to the student council (room 25.12.01.18) and asking us. How to attend the tutorials is usually discussed in the first lecture.

If you have any questions, you can always drop by the student council (room 25.12.01.18) or give us a call (0211 81 14846). We are available all day during the lecture period and will be happy to help you.
