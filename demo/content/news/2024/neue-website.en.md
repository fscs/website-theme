#### Technical details
We have finally left Wordpress after 15 years. We have switched to the Static Site Generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
We built the frontend with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com).
The backend runs a web server written in Rust, based on [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/). 
The source code of the frontend and the server can be viewed on our [GitHub](https://github.com/fscs/).
