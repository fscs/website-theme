## What is the Computer Science Student Council?

The Computer Science Student Council is made up of all students enrolled in the Computer Science degree.
The interests of these students are represented by the student council.

## What is a student council?

The student council consists of a maximum of 28 students (according to the total number of students in Summer Semester 2024)
and is elected by the students once a year. This council has the task of representing the interests of the
students and assisting them with problems, questions or other concerns.

This includes, among other things

- Discussing and solving problems with professors/lecturers
- Orientation of first semester students (see ESAG)
- Collecting and handing out exams and scripts

In addition, we offer other events, e.g. game nights, tournaments or programming crash courses and 
are happy to receive more suggestions from other students. A more detailed overview
of our tasks can be found [here](./aboutus/aufgaben.en.md). A public meeting is held every week during the lecture period,
to which visitors are most welcome. In this meeting, we discuss current tasks and concerns
of the student council. The exact dates are published on this website (but usually have a regularity in themselves).

## How do you become a member of the student council and what are your duties?

The general election meeting takes place 7 to 14 days before the annual student council election.
A candidacy must be submitted in writing by this date at the latest. The relevant form is available 
in the student council room.

We recommend that all those who wish to be elected to the student council introduce themselves to 
the current student council beforehand. Just drop by some time and explain how you would like to get involved in the
Council: organizing and helping with events, introducing a new type of event, Administration of server and infrastructure, 
purchase of snacks and drinks, social media, the newsletter, managing the e-mail inbox ...

Irrespective of the tasks with fixed responsibilities, every councillor is expected to attend the meetings, 
which usually take place weekly ,help with the ESAG and answer questions and concerns from students to the best of their
knowledge and belief. You can find a more detailed description of the things we do [here](./aboutus/aufgaben.en.md).
