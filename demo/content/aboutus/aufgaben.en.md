There are loads of different tasks in the student council. Everyone can choose what they enjoy doing. The list of tasks on this page is long, but they are divided up among all the councillors. Most of them are fun, and only a few are compulsory for everyone.

A big part of our work is the events we offer. This involves organising them or helping to set up and clean up afterwards, etc. Of course, in addition to the list below, you can always suggest new events.
## Events

Events that we currently (want to) organize regularly:

- Game nights
- Magic game nights
- Wizard tournaments
- MarioKart tournaments
- Pub quizzes
- LAN parties
- Console evenings
- Movie nights (in cooperation with [Campuskino](https://www.unifilm.de/studentenkinos/Duesseldorf))
- Programming crash courses
- Exam tutorials
- Linux Install Party

## INPhiMa events

Events that we organize with INPhiMa:

- ESAGs (at the start of the winter semester)
- Freshman trips (once in the winter semester)
- Christmas parties
- Barbecues (at the start and end of each semester)
- Mulled wine stands
- Karaoke evenings (approximately every two months)

At the InPhiMa events, we usually need lots of helpers, especially at the events for first semester students, as there are so many of them. So, you should be prepared to help out at most events. But there's also always the chance to help with setting up or cleaning up, so you can take time off during the events themselves.

We also work with other student councils to put on events like:
- Graduation parties
- Semester kick-off and end BBQs
- Pen & Paper Days

## Advising students

Another big part of our work is giving students advice. Students often come to us, especially first-semester students, with quick questions or sometimes more in-depth problems. We then deal with them in detail.
 We also get lots of emails that need to be answered quickly. It's important to have a basic understanding of examination regulations and where to find answers quickly. If you don't know something, you can always ask another member for help. Nobody knows everything, after all. :wink:.

## Council-Meetings

Attendance at meetings is expected of every Councillor. Anyone who cannot 
for a valid reason (for example: lectures, inflexible working hours, sickness) will be excused.
However, councillors should attend the majority of meetings. Meetings last about an hour on average.

## Other tasks

In addition to events, there are many other roles you can take on, 
on either a short or long term basis. These include

- Maintaining the home page content: News, industry events, calendar, links to modules, etc.
