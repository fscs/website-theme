Here we collect dates of events from the IT sector in the DÃ¼sseldorf area,
that may be of interest to you and that give you the opportunity to network with working computer scientists or companies (i.e. potential employers).
(i.e. potential employers). These include events organised by rheinjug
events (for which you can also get credits), Clojure meetups and hackathons.
Unless otherwise stated, participation in the events is free of charge.
You can find an overview of events organised by us here.
